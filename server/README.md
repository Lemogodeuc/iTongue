This project uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) so it assumes that you have a minimum knowledge with [SQL](https://sql.sh/) language and be confortable with PostgreSQL.

To be able to use iTongue, please follow thoose steps:

- [Create a new role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createrole.html) WITH LOGIN and give it whatever password you want. Keep it in mind, you'll need it quickly again.

Example:

```SQL
CREATE ROLE "itongue" WITH LOGIN 'GjqS.jDVxUBGv6*+';
```

- [Create a new database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-createdatabase.html) and set the owner to be the role previously created.

Example :

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE "itonguedb" OWNER "itongue";
```

You know have a new database to work with.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ - Prepare your migrations

---

To work easily with the database, this project uses [Sqitch](https://sqitch.org/) to manage all migrations. You can follow previous link to install it and learn quickly how to work with it.

Once installed (and the tutorial followed it's your very first use), open a new terminal (or with the one you have already open), make sure you still in the `server` folder.

Once done, please create a new file called `sqitch.conf` in the root folder and copy-past the code you have in the `sqitch-example.conf` file. Then, replace `<DATABASE_ROLE>`, `<DATABASE_PASSWORD>` and `<DATABASE>` by yours.

To make sure everything is fine, you can run in your terminal the command:

```bash
sqitch deploy
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ - Prepare your `.env` file

---

You'll need some environment variables to make your project run well. To do so, please refer to the `.env.example` file. You'll need to create your own `.env` file in the same directory and replace the example values by yours.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ - Run the project
